            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a globally minded Information Systems student with a deep passion for designing secure, human-centred digital systems that respond to Africa’s most urgent challenges. After living in Japan for five years, I developed a deep appreciation for the power of integrated technology — from everyday user experience to national-level cybersecurity infrastructure. That journey inspired my mission to become a driver of African tech policy, digital transformation, and system resilience.
                Currently completing my BCom in Information Systems at the University of Johannesburg, I have led digital innovation projects in UI/UX design, agile project management, and business system development. I aspire to build scalable, inclusive, and cyber-secure solutions — and to help shape the digital policies that will protect and empower Africa’s next generation.

                <h3>Afri-Intelligence Web Application</h3>
                <p>
                    Afri-Intelligence is a digital learning platform designed to support students and teachers across Africa by making education more accessible, personalized, and engaging. The platform allows students to register and log in, access past exam papers, use text-to-speech tools for better comprehension, and explore a terms glossary to strengthen subject understanding.
                    Teachers can also register to upload learning materials and support students directly. A key feature of Afri-Intelligence is its AI-driven assistant, tailored to the African education context, which helps students with explanations, study support, and personalized learning recommendations.
